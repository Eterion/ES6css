/// Returns a **$number** recalculated to rem units. This function and its [**em**](#function-em) counterpart should be used on every absolute value, to allow scaling based on root font size. This function returns its original input number if **$const-relative-units-enabled** is set to **false**. To ensure visibility of all elements, numbers equal or below **$const-relative-units-min** are not recalculated.
