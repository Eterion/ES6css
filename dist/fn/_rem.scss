/// Returns a **$number** recalculated to em units, if possible. It's recommended to use this function and its [**em**](#function-em) counterpart on every non-relative value, to allow scaling based on **const-default-key** key of the **const-font-size-scale** constant. To ensure visibility of all elements, resulting numbers equal or below **$const-relative-units-min** are not recalculated. By default, this function returns its original input number, unless enabled by setting **$const-relative-units-enabled** to **true**. Use [**rem-always**](#function-rem-always) if you wish to convert to relative units, regardless of global settings.
/// @access public
/// @param {number} $number - Source number
/// @example rem(14px) // returns 1rem

@function rem($number) {
  @return em($number, rem);
}
