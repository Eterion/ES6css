> A collection of tools for css development, inspired by ES6 export and import mechanics, using [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor.

## What's this?

It started as a experimental custom framework for web application, that would eliminate the need for multiple variables per component. Eventually, I've reduced the complexity, removed bunch of stuff that were too specific and made it more simple and independent.

The main features is the **export** and **import** mechanics, inspired by ES6 specification, that allows to create modules (components) with properties and using those properties in css definitions, all without the need of multiple variables for each module.

## Setup

Can be installed via your favorite package manager with access to npm registry, for example `yarn add esm-scss`.
