## About

It started as an experimental custom framework for a web application, that would
eliminate the need to repeat component name multiple times per file. Eventually,
I've reduced the complexity, removed bunch of stuff that were too specific and
made it more simple and independent.

The main feature of this thing is the **export** and **import** mechanics,
inspired by ES6 specification, that allows to create modules with properties and
using those properties in css, only by using mixin instead of multiple
variables.
