# Constants

There are several variables (I've named them constants, because internally they're not changed) to configure this library. All of them have reasonable defaults (I hope so, seems reasonable to me), so configuration is totally optional.

Constants variables always start with `const` prefix and are defined with `!default` flag, so your custom configuration must be added before the `esm` import.
